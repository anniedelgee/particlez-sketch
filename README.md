# particlez-sketch p5js library

## Abstract
This was a sketch done using the p5.js library, following a Traversy Media tutorial on youtube. A few details were personalised, the colour scheme as well as size of logo but not very much has been changed. This exercise helped familiarise me with basic functions built into the library and get started thinking about how to apply javascript loops, classes and OOP to produce visual programs.

## Usage
This is a single page sketch with no interactivity. Users need only open deployed webpage, and watch the randomised motion of the particles and their connectors changing relative to their positions.
